      description: 'The Voidmaster''s mask came from the pile of belongings left in his wake. What remained of his existence is shrouded in mystery and might melt away if one looks too closely. Some say he is from another dimension and it was his deeds that shifted the balance between that dimension and the dimension we now inhabit. What will happen to this world when the balance is restored? No one can be certain, but many romanticize the possibilities.'
    - name: Screaming Elephant Mask
      description: 'The people of the burning steppe are a violent race and though they speak in great booming voices, to speak to one in an inadequate voice is considered a great insult. One fateful day a naive traveler submitted to their will with low moans of disappointment after shattering his voice on their inhospitable terrain. The traveler sought consolation at the edge of their nation, in the limestone thermal pools. But so unlucky he was that a family of elephant warriors followed him, and they trampled him, leaving behind only this mask.'
    - name: Illusion of Pain Mask
      description: 'In the haunted city of Al''Sei in the Iron Kingdoms, a tiny ghost appears in her own mask and laughs with her own voice. The story says that there''s nothing behind the mask, it''s just air, but from time to time a sharp stab can be felt from behind the mask that cuts deep. The pain is brief but when it''s gone, a strange feeling remains. Who is brave enough to don this haunted mask and learn its secret.'
    - name: Miscellaneous Helm
      description: 'The Creekside Bridge was an old bridge, as bridges go. Silent waves lapped at its broken boards, mercifully instead of relentlessly. A young traveller found himself on that same bridge in the dead of winter, wandering the creekbanks looking for a pleasant campfire to warm this unforgiving evening. Camping beneath the bridge, he noticed a disheveled duck, a forest ogre and a huge frog strolling by. This helmet had sunk to the creek''s floor, lifting along with the water from the rushing river towards the bridge, and with the help of the ogre, the duck, and the frog, he retrieved it.'
    - name: Entanglement Mask
      description: 'Emotional ties are psychic cords woven from symbolic thinking and emotional feedback loops. These ties are sometimes called mea culpae and are used by a spare few emotomancers of the Fabrikator Collective in spells and rituals as conduits and anchors for emotional feedback.  When done without care, this emotional feedback could spell disaster. The wearer of this mask is lost in emotional pathways, trading self for self again, and again, and again.'
    - name: Stonespire Mask
      description: 'A cold, heartless cabal is said to have conducted perverse and inhumane experiments on a colossal being located in an underground tower, a strange geologic formation. The Stonespire Mask was found embedded in the earth near this spire and is said to carry a fragment of the spirit of the creature that was experimented upon.  The depraved stone mages who resided there are long gone, and some believe that the spirit who was stuffed in the mask still haunts the dark tower.'
    - name: Diving Mask
      description: 'This mask was found with other diving equipment on an expedition to the South of the DAO lands, where an ancient city is said to be obscured on the edge of a mountain that overlooks the sea. Signs of great floods and landslides still scar the surrounding areas, which is likely to be the remains of an ancient pre-Protectorate city.  It was theorized by an explorer that this mask was taken from the city during its destruction and hurriedly left in a relic cave in the south.'
    - name: Golden Coin Greep Mask
      description: 'The imperious Golden Coin Greep used to perch high on a tall skyscraper, wearing this mask collecting a tax from any not keeping careful watch of their coinpurses, but fell from its resting place during one of the many wars between the Crypto Roman Empire and the Iron Kingdoms. Stunned by its unceremonious descent, it crashed through roofs of many homes. Some say if one dons this lost mask, it will show you where there are hidden treasures within your world.'
    - name: Stash Mask
      description: 'It is said that the creature that created this mask was little likely to put it to good use. It was likely stashed away by its maker, wedged into the interior of a deep lair where it lay dormant for hundreds of years, gathering dust and grime as no one dug into the crevasses of this place to disturb it. The Scorps Cyst Mask must have been a trophy, or a signifier of conquest, according to pathfinders who have seen it. Yet, if that is the case, what is it conquering?' 
    - name: Fruit of the Savannah
      description: 'In the savannah just to the south of the arctic jungle there was a tribe of frugivores secluded from the rest of the world. They raised humble families on the earth and enjoyed what their land had to provide. But there was a group of outsiders that took note of their steady existence, so they invited them in to offer them bread and wine. They invited sirens in their festivities, who used their voices to enchant the savannah dwellers. The Fruit of the Savannah is just another bauble taken from those enchanted.'
    - name: The Sleeping Stalker
      description: 'A young traveler who had fled the misfortune of all his problems finally arrived at his destination, exhausted on the shore of a desiccated riverbed. Wearily, he took off his boots but was soon disturbed by a pair of creeping golden eyes in the distance grinning in wicked delight as a creature arched its back and lept towards him. The creature shrieked, reeling backwards and displaying its fearsome teeth and possessing the young traveler with horrific fear. This sleeping creature''s mask was found near the trade routes on top of a pile of leaves.'
    - name: Frog Slayer's Mask
      description: 'This mask lies in the depths of a vast underground lake, protected within the humid auspices of a rare frog statue with regenerating abilities. It is unknown how the mask came to be.  Perhaps the frog climbed out of his lair after an earthquake, into an underground lake and perished, immortalized in stone, leaving behind only this mask. Perhaps he was slain by a powerful force. For some reason, this mask is soaked in the blood of both man and beast.'
    - name: Crystal Ball Hail Mask
      description: 'During the sixteen bloody days of the Battle of Hollywood, a splendid and ornate ball adorned with gems was reportedly shattered upon the ground. Lying scattered across the battlefield, so small were these broken shards that they were easily lost.

    - name: Grief Cataclysm Mask
      description: 'In the far north, the Sun rises and sets with cruel speed, like an inferno all but quenched, a cycle of death and rebirth, without time to mourn the departures longingly. The Empire attempted to carve out a kingdom in these lands. But soon history will forget these attemps as winds change, and outposts melt away to become part of the barren tundra. If one possesses this mask, wearing it is too much of a burden for the soul unless one can look upon the sunrise each day.'
    - name: Ash Mask of the First Fools
      description: 'The First Fools come from the ashes of the most powerful wootgump plants, which they themselves burned when they committed a great folly. In the ashes they hid peacefully and crafted this mask. They are the first and most foolish of the Retro Vikings because they have no need for warring, or anger, or ambition. Though given past performance in life, these emotions (and more) will inevitably return, and so will the introspective Retro Vikings.'
    - name: Funky Punky Pet Mask
      description: 'Deep in the crypt of a spooky cemetery, in the middle of a misty morning, an explorer was headed to their final reward. As their coffin drifted on its bier through the gates, the unfortunate soul within reached out with one final request, that someone find their pet peacock and give him his favorite green rattle. So it was, as the peals of laughter echoed through the woods, that explorers placed this funky mask on the hollowed out skull of their young explorer.'
    - name: Tarot Mask
      description: 'The inside of this mask is adorned with tarot symbols and has been known to tell fortunes in lands far from home. Some say it was brought back to the Crypto Roman Empire on the back of a knight who was rumored to have found it on a lengthy quest. The glyphs run rampant, as if taunting one without a map, unless through the mask can one find the path.  Perhaps then the masked Tarot reader would find themselves amongst new friends and distant lands as they partook in an adventure befitting their destiny.'
    - name: Dusty mask
      description: 'The Blood Crescent clan of the Iron Kingdoms harbors a rare obsession with compiling records, documents and texts in its private Library. So great is their obsession that they often collect mundane writings from throughout the Empire to add to their Library.

The Dusty Mask is an accoutrement of this rare book.'
    - name: City's Apostle Mask
      description: 'The people of the Imperial Capital do not share their power and secrets easily, but the stories spoken of this mask go something like this: The mask is said to have been carried by a man who saved the city from disaster but was imprisoned and hanged in gratitude. Consider what sort of luck and fate one would have if they happened to be wearing the City''s Apostle Mask during a procession, and if fate dictates, it must be put on.'
    - name: Renneker Mask 
      description: 'This mask is rumored to have been made from the skinned head of an ogre. Those who have seen the mask believe so because such a creature was once spotted carrying it. What does one do when such a thing wanders near their town? Brave souls confronted it in an attempt to collect this bone-cored mask. The brave warriors of the town of Renneker returned with this prized mask.  They celebrated their victory and wore the masks collected from the ogre as they opened their tavern at the edge of town.'
    - name: Divining Dive Mask
      description: 'Diving for lost treasure is a game we all play. Most have learned the hard way that diving into the deep also means diving into the past. Every watery endeavor that takes one into the deep risks the memories that the ancients might have long since released. The divining mask was recovered from a chamber below the Sea of Tears, but was forgotten by those who found it.  Those who specialize in scrying with water can put this mask on to take a quick glimpse into the memories of the lagoon.'
    - name: Earl of Mirage's Mask
      description: 'It is said that this mask is related to lands in the north. Some speak of this place as an empire of stormy seas, far beyond the last spires of your ancestors. The few tales tell that they suffered a great existential cataclysm where one night turned into many nights in a row. It is said that it''s last true inhabitant wore this mask while watching the horizon, forever wondering whether the glorious sun would return. Others say that these are words to lure one in, for those who wear this mask experience the terrible chill of the north.'
    - name: Twelfth Night Mask
      description: 'Twelfth Night is a celebration known only to the Retro Vikings, who live much further north than most ever venture. The Twelfth Night mask is rumored to contain the life span of someone with a big heart and the heart of one who is vain, a combination that could suggest that it once contained a mix of two spirits, or two entities of one''s self. The Retro Vikings have never come across this kind of creature before, but it could be alive in the world. There are traders who propose that if you find a match to this mask, you will find stillness and clarity in your heart.'
    - name: Forgotten Battler's Mask
      description: 'Its design is unknown but these masks are said to have been forged in the fire by the great inventor, maker of all things. They were left to the Wastelands to be forgotten and found by their new keepers. Rumors persist that their great purpose lies in their design and it is only a matter of time before somebody discovers what lies beneath the  mask: the eyes that only witness battles.'
    - name: Corporate Man Mask
      description: 'Larger and more refined than the average Crypto Roamer, the Crypto Corporate Man had his origins within the ranks of the Crypto Roman traders and thrived as an organizer of caravans. Corporates were originally reviled but soon became powerful members of society throughout the empire because of their diligence to tasks (though most agree they overdo it). The Corporate Man who acquired this mask is one who smells of rich oils and spices, sees blood in every deal, and travels to the edges of civilization with nothing more than a sack of gold and a single iron scimitar.'
    - name: Moloch's Crown
      description: 'At the deepest level of the dungeon in the westernmost steppes, where the sky doesn''t seem to get any lighter the deeper you go, there is a single throne overlooking a bonfire where once a now unfamiliar figure used to sit. Sadly, not much remains of his misadventures and this crown is the only item of value to be found.  Those claiming to have worn this crown have been bestowed unnatural bravery. Unsurprisingly, however, the bravest villains are bitterest monsters.'
    - name: Generic Helm
      description: 'A bounty hunter who confronted a phantom of the deep forest wearing this helmet likely found it to be largely ornamental, and it was abandoned while they fled. It''s an effective mask at frightening anyone not watching where you come from, but it''s also heavy and cumbersome. One who wears this helm should make haste in battle, or he may find himself without it.'
    - name: Gold Idol Mask
      description: 'While exploring the derelict mason''s city of Lacarum at the top of an isolated mountain, a small intrepid posse bushwacked their way through the ivy coating an outcropping stone wall, and found this! This gold idol mask was found in a remote and largely forgotten shrine to a forgotten oracle. Somewhere, there are riches to claim by donning this find!'
    - name: Cannibalistic Fear Mask
      description: 'There are a couple ghouls in this world that are cannibals. They use this type of mask to scare off animals and people to get easier access to prey. They have many of these masks, collected from ancient ruins and troves. They mostly use them to invoke fear into fresh meat, but the idols can be disguised to fool any straying travelers. Be careful when approaching a strange mask you may find on your travels.'
    - name: Lich Queen Mask
      description: 'A Lich Queen was so obsessed with the treasures of an ancient civilization on the Archipelago of Tohoku that she spent her living days seeking out lost cities and dreaming of the day when she might drink their finest wines, eat their rarest delicacies, and walk their jeweled paths. Her fortune paid for many expeditions, but all to no avail. Criticized for being both extravagant and foolish, she was mocked by her academic peers. Refusing to admit defeat, she sunk all of her wealth into one last, desperate expedition, which recovered this mask, but never sated her thirst for treasure.'
    - name: The Spiteful Castmask
      description: 'Deep in the steamy jungles to the north, in a cave full of snakes, spiders, and other nasties, only the bravest of fiends would tarry. Enough courage was found to explore as deep as can be hacked through a crawling ravine.  To reward their courage and make it safe for a general to cross this gully, a trove of items from ages past were found, including this castmask. The face is said to not fit any living person though it gives a sense of meanness that is enough for most warlords.'
    - name: Leviathan Skull Mask
      description: 'This skull mask was found in a chest that was hidden in the depths of an icy cove, far North of the Capricorn coast of the Empire. More powerful than any man and blown by a forceful wind from its perch, it was watched closely and closely guarded after fishermen recovered it.  It is believed that this giant but primitive leviathan was worshipped by many, and the mask crafted at its behest. For anyone brave enough to pilfer such a find though, it could well be an integral bargaining chip.'
    - name: Manichoreana Festival Mask
      description: 'A luxurious festival mask made many years ago in honour of the Empress Manichoreana. This effigy is a gift from her gracious and exalted hands. It was sculpted in the likeness of the Death God, but over the years its visage became brittle and fell away.  When the war broke out, there wasn''t time to fashion a new mask and so they used this one. The young man who wore it had much success in the Colosseum and in the battles that followed. And you now find it here.'
    - name: Discord Crawler
      description: 'The Nortons, an unusually progressive Retro Viking tribe, had taken an interest in the arts of life. It was an interest that was poorly understood, but one which led to the great schism that would destroy the Norton people from within. For where the Nortons were able to advance themselves technologically, the more traditional members of their culture saw it as a breaking of sacred traditions that had lasted from the earliest of memories. It was these traditionalists who first designed this peculiar sentinel''s mask for the rising darkness.'
    - name: Ultimatum Mask
      description: 'The terrible race of faceless ones who dwell between the worlds of the living and the dead, have been seen to take this mask that is as thin as air and insubstantial as fog, avoiding the fate of their own race, building a treasury of lies to distract travelers from the harsh and distressing truths of life.  Though they don''t appear to speak when their faces go bare, those blessed by their masks hear the chants and whispers of faceless ones.'
    - name: Cardboard Burglar Mask
      description: 'Paying close attention, an explorer has noted that the Cardboard Burglar''s mask seems to have been picked up from pieces of debris on an upper floor in the city of Kita, famous for its clock towers. It may have been wrapped in a window dressing from the bodega street market, the curtain to a private residence, or one of the banners that greet travelers exiting the city walls. A truly magnificent feat of fashioning has gone into this creation, it was not just thrown together!'
    - name: Mask of the Lost
      description: 'Perhaps the most perplexing thing about the Mask of the Lost is that the legend tells of a small village in the heart of the steppe, Bladewind, far from civilization and unusually peaceful, unwilling or simply unaware of their namesake. They say that a boy who grew up outside the boundaries of natural peace would return to that village once every year and donate a mask, yet he would never take anything in exchange. This artifact  is said to be the forgotten mask, one the boy left in the town without speaking to anyone.'

    - name: Power of Unyielding Thought
      description: 'The Mind Divine is said to have secrets that tell the story of the gods before the gods. Secrets so old they could not be written down, they can only be expressed in thoughts.

The relic promises untold knowledge and power when worn. But there is those who fear that it would corrupt its wearer beyond all measure.' 
    - name: Bone Rattler Mask
      description: 'In the northern regions, not far from the arctic jungle,  all sorts of animals walk on four and two legs. They do this effortlessly at the top of unbelievably tall trees and on the ground. With its grim injuries, cloudy eyes, and terrifying spectre of death and decay, this fetid creature looked like an animal.

    - name: Lightbringer Mask
      description:  'This mask was found on top of an ancient temple, it is said to emit light from its mouth and eyes when worn by a worthy warrior. The explorer who submitted this mask for inclusion in the colosseum had used this mask during a fierce battle, aptly surprising his enemies and dodging their numberless arrows thanks to the mask''s light. It is said that the first use of the mask requires a brave soul to undertake a side quest while gravely injured, demanding a commemorative scar that can never be healed.'
    - name: Stone Wars Helm
      description: 'This helm was ironically used in a bellicose clash of civilizations, far from the borders of its homeland. The clash took place at shield mouth, an ancient training ground used by an unknown empire of defensives. Isolated and barren, these regal ruins were long abandoned when a battle erupted sometime between two ancient peoples.

      description: 'The people of the Burning Steppes have a fearsome but strangely endearing way of napping, telling tales in their slumber, and the dragon skull mask is indeed a sharing device for one of their great myths, that of the dragon Kamyal.

Brought to life by the mountain''s own screams, Kamyal is the ravener that burnt villages to the ground, she is the one who might have been called queen if the humans tried to make her one. This mask was found in her hoard after she fled the steppe.'
    - name: Eternal Mask
      description: 'It is said that no one can ever take away the memories of this mask, because it casts its memory in obsidian, forging a relic that will last for eternity.

After being adopted from the South of the Land Bridges, it was shunned by all who knew it.

The mask may grant a strange aspect but ask yourself, who would ever want to wear such an otherworldly curse?'
    - name: Revolutionary Betrayal Shield
      description: 'Infected by a plague, the curse manifested on this mask, glowing with a putrid green light. Iron spikes protruding from the mask made it unusable by any but the most stalwart warrior, lest he or she risk impalement. Stained with corruption and riveted in history, it must not be forgotten. It was held by the least loyal men who died conquering the opposing forces of a monarch who had once been their sovereign.

It was found in Fort Purdius, a fortress on the north border of the Crypto Roman Empire that guards against the followers of Chaos and their vile thralls.

    - name: Chainrattler Mask
      description: 'This mask was found in a cavern beneath the Sabrum Dek monument in the DAO lands. The cavern was littered with human bones, so it is clear someone imprisoned here never escaped. One document on the desk of this unincarcerated victim condemned and denounced that unholy act they called colonization and the chainrattler was left there, in the shadows of the monument, as their gesture of defiance. It''s unclear how come this satchel was the only artifact left behind, but it is the most nefarious article in the tomb and so it is included.'

    - name: Personal Income Generator
      description: 'The nameless Gizmocrat entrepreneur who engineered this device had a desperation for invention, like a train without brakes. Bombarded by stupid ideas, the inventor invented an idea that would let the concept take over in another man''s life, risking dire consequences that the mage himself was too afraid to face.

One hand twisted the streaming, silken reins while the other soothed and stroked the child''s raven hair.

Behind her, her mysterious procession plodded wearily towards a destination foretold by mystery and doom.'
    - name: Mask of Rumor
      description: 'This mask is stained with tales of travelers and other beings, the likes of which cannot be found where it was found.

Theories abound, but this is the only artifact that ties all of the seemingly disparate tales together.'

      description: 'A mask interred in the heart of a golden homunculus.  The wizard who created this creature sought to emulate the supreme being and the sacred fire many different times, but with varying success. In his last attempt, he created a creature that was in many ways aberrant, but it was more imbued with a potent energy than his previous attempts.

    - name: Plain Pith Mask
      description: 'Stay Open minded. That''s the only slogan this company has. They don''t want to put their name on the masks, they just want their slogan be appreciated by the masses. The plain pith mask is a testament to the company''s modesty, but it also has blank plastic eyes that behoove a sense of caution. This makeshift hero does not want to take responsibility for its own claims, for it does not want the public to rely too heavily on them, either. The company motto has more to do with the airlessness of their work than anything else.'

The traveler had a reputation for making the ladies of the people swoon, but this mask had nothing to do with it.'
