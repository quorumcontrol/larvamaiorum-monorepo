  "name": "Pulsatio Maxima Mask",
  "description": "The mask of the Pulsatio Maxima animates in places of great bloodlust and energy. Some say that it is the beating heart of a giant hulking thing that exerts its domination by subjugating those who defy it. Others say it is the helm of an interdimensional invader that led a battle of armies across reality. Some say that is a fragment of a collapsing star billions of miles in diameter; an unseen force of impossibly bad luck that travels from world to world, seeping into desolate landscapes and triggering chaos.",
