  "description": "Legend has it that this mask was worn by a shy, unknown woman at her wedding. Trapped and cursed in a marriage she only just barely tolerated, the faces of other women that once adorned this mask steadily withered. The bride could no longer cut herself out of her world through death so by the time her husband died, the husband's succor, she had grown made lace to replace her false face. On that night when the groom passed away... there was just enough life to ignite one last grimace, the face of this mask.",
