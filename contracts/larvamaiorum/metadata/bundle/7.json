  "name": "Mask of the Lost",
  "description": "Perhaps the most perplexing thing about the Mask of the Lost is that the legend tells of a small village in the heart of the steppe, Bladewind, far from civilization and unusually peaceful, unwilling or simply unaware of their namesake. They say that a boy who grew up outside the boundaries of natural peace would return to that village once every year and donate a mask, yet he would never take anything in exchange. This artifact  is said to be the forgotten mask, one the boy left in the town without speaking to anyone.",
