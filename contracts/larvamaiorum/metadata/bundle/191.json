  "name": "Sailor's Mask of True Love",
  "description": "The ancient sages of the DAO have their legends of the first sailor who braved the seas, who descended into the deep with a fish  on his line to find the secret of true love. The sages whisper that this knowledge can still be found if a sailor does not drown.  This is the mask of the sailors and fisherman, to help keep the wearer as safe from drowning as possible.  It is said that this mask was found in the deeps or a ghostly fishing boat, though that is only suggested by the emblem.",
