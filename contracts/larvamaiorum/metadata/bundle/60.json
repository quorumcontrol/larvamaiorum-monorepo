  "description": "In the haunted city of Al'Sei in the Iron Kingdoms, a tiny ghost appears in her own mask and laughs with her own voice. The story says that there's nothing behind the mask, it's just air, but from time to time a sharp stab can be felt from behind the mask that cuts deep. The pain is brief but when it's gone, a strange feeling remains. Who is brave enough to don this haunted mask and learn its secret.",
