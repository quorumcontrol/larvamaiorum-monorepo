  "description": "Although this mask is seldom seen in auction houses, it is most often seen in the hands of ninjas; the alien entities with the ability to walk through walls. When a ninja would bring ruin to a household, his reputation would precede him. A household would only be safe from the ninja once this mask was acquired and someone donned it.",
