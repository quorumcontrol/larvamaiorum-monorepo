  "name": "Ironsilk Mask",
  "description": "Once worn during the Royal Forest Court's first night of festivities, this mask was found guarded by an iron spider in the royal forest by a fellow reveler. It is constructed of spidersilk and has an engraving on the back that says \"Fair Folk, midnight secret, count stars under a silken mask.\"   Few know what to expect when coming up against these otherworldly iron spiders, but those who do have a tendency to avoid eye contact whenever possible. This mask must never be worn in daylight.",
