  "description": "This mask is said to hold the truth of the universe, though it is unpleasant and without form. It is said that when one is ready to take it, they will know.  With its powers, even the most morally corrupt person of limitless power can become a spiritual god, a protector of peace and virtue.  The mask can show even the least introspective minds precisely what they need to overcome the downward spiral of sin",
