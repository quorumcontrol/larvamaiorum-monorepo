  "name": "Latzu Frenzy Mask",
  "description": "Carved from dragon bone, Latzu masks were first discovered in the war torn ruins of an ancient temple in the Tahari Highlands by a settler. These wild lands once contained an army that had battled there. Judging by the scorch marks and the way the bodies had been scattered all over, it's thought that a skirmish took place and the survivors of that long ago conflict were inhumanely massacred by these masks. Luckily for us, a Latzu mask was found unscathed.",
