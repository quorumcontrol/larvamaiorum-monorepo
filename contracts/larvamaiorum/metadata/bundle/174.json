  "description": "Warships have a long, colorful history. Vessels that carried convicts to captivity, children away from danger, beasts of a burden and riches across the seas. The Lyuerog had none of these ambitious goals. A white vessel left burning in the sand after running aground, she succumbed to the Iron Winds that traveled with her from a faraway shore. The only person to explore her remains was an innocent soldier who slept more soundly for finding and this exotic mask taken from within its hold.",
