  "name": "Mask of Twisting Vestiges",
  "description": "This mask is bright and festive on the outside, with a cheery opening on the bottom and a thorny crown at its crest. Happy eyes peer inquisitively from deep within its confines. But look closer  and find that it has a living mouth, twisted in anger and hunger and so very, very hungry.  The mask wanders and wants to caress, but a single touch of its crackling surface will set a man aflame. Who has been chasing the mask, or who the mask has been chasing?",
