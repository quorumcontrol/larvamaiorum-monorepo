  "description": "Those that first saw this mask in the clutches of a dark devourer assumed that it was actually a fruit that is eaten and liquefied instantly by this creature. The Dark Devourer Mask was taken as bounty by one who had spotted this beast while it was feeding on a group of Black Beast Zombies. These beasts bolt in and devour exhausted, fleeing enemies with their powerful claws, and are the rightful rulers of the night.",
