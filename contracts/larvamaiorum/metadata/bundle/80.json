  "name": "Hephasm Helm",
  "description": "It's said that Hephasm can be induced by the memories of crushing pressure and the roar of displaced seawater. When the great ancient dragon turtle smashed through a natural arch of rock called Dvorcail to make way for himself, wide gouts of water rose up and covered the landscape with a deluge. This lead to many speculations about whether or not the mask sprung forth from one of those gouts.",
