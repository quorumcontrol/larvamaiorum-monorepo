  "description": "The Forest of Yelk was once home to giants, whole communities living together in harmony, until the arrival of a conniving regime to seize the vast riches that had been taken from the earth. These woodsmen ran a profitable but fearsome regime, where no mean creature lived except as per their rules. Foxes and wolves posed as witnesses as lowly thieves dangled from the gallows. Yet the headsman had no desire to swing, preferring instead to work among the living, squeezing them into utter submission. The fox jockey, miller and a tax collector  knew this man to be evil and elusive, for his very chambers were filled with scathing whispers. Hence, in secret, they snatched away this mask and drank to their secret victory.",
