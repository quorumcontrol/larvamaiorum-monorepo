  "description": "The skull of a creature long since deceased enters the world to beg of you this one rare bane. Sometimes it has a point to make while other times it merely speaks to say goodbye to you: \"farewell\". The Ghostly Skull demands the remembrance of what has turned to dust before arrogance turns the living into ghosts.",
