  "description": "Twelfth Night is a celebration known only to the Retro Vikings, who live much further north than most ever venture. The Twelfth Night mask is rumored to contain the life span of someone with a big heart and the heart of one who is vain, a combination that could suggest that it once contained a mix of two spirits, or two entities of one's self. The Retro Vikings have never come across this kind of creature before, but it could be alive in the world. There are traders who propose that if you find a match to this mask, you will find stillness and clarity in your heart.",
