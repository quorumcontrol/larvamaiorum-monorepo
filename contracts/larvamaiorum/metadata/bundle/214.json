  "name": "Tyvian Skin Mask",
  "description": "A dark and forbidding deity, Tyvian has come to be known as a distant manifestation of the deathly realm. Worshippers in pursuit of the secrets of this god's dark history, often left themselves unprotected and armorless in colosseum deathmatches as a display of faith in his eminence.  This mask is believed to be safely ensconced inside the ruler of Tyvian's tombs.  A warrior entering this den with the intent to retrieve it, released two days later, never recovered their identity.",
