  "description": "The darkest in the world that possesses the vast, true potential of the void's endless abyss where each decision is not just an imperative but also a life.One day, an old man with shaggy waterwhite hair found a strange stone on the bank of a rushing stream. He found no explanation for how it got there. He wasn't even sure if it had any connection with anything in world, or that anything should even exist.  The wise, old man named the stone Nightshade, and cracked it open in his workshop to reveal this mask, a befuddling artifact.",
