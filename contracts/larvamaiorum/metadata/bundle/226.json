  "description": "This mask was found in the Town of the Sky's the Limit, rich with treasures from the new world and it's explorer: a wise tradesman whose greed got the better of him. Customary to their culture, those who are destined to die great deaths must inhale a clove of garlic for three days before receiving a title, none greater than \"King\". The trader stayed behind for his royal coronation and when a new trade ship from the new world returned, they were surprised to find \"The King\" resting on his ornate riches and wearing this mask with anguish in his eyes.",
