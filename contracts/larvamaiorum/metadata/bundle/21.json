  "name": "Shipwrecked Mask",
  "description": "This mask is said to have worn the brave faces of many who had to spend years at sea, making it a relic of old seafaring eras. Many questing sailors have made the journey to find this mask, but some had never come back. The claims that this mask is cursed by a sea god are still unconfirmed, but not unheard of.  The few sailors who found the mask returned home bearing frightening tales of a storm that has never before been seen.",
