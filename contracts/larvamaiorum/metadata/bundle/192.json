  "name": "Mountain Machination Mask",
  "description": "The Water Machine Mask is an ancient symbol of power in the mountain regions of Moris. It is said that somewhere in these lands is a massive fortress hidden deep inside a great mountain. The mask was given as a prize following a riddle that rewarded the first living creature to solve this monumental puzzle. The riddle's author instructed those interested in competing for the mask to start a visionfinding journey, for the mountains have been here for much longer than any living creature on this land.",
