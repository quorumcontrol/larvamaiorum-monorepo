  "name": "Lightbringer Mask",
  "description": "This mask was found on top of an ancient temple, it is said to emit light from its mouth and eyes when worn by a worthy warrior. The explorer who submitted this mask for inclusion in the colosseum had used this mask during a fierce battle, aptly surprising his enemies and dodging their numberless arrows thanks to the mask's light. It is said that the first use of the mask requires a brave soul to undertake a side quest while gravely injured, demanding a commemorative scar that can never be healed.",
