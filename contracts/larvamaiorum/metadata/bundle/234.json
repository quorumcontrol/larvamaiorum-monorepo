  "description": "This mask was found on the seashore of the Shoal Islands, in an underwater tomb guarded by bubbling skulls. The journal of a long lost civilization tells of a great cataclysm that took place some 12,000 years ago, and that this mask was the mortician's final project, meant to convey not just the living face of a brave and noble warrior, but also the thoughtful countenance of their ancestors.",
