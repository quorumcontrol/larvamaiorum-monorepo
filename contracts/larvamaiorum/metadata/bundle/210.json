  "description": "Once a princess of the Iron Kingdoms, Haarya was prized above all of the other maidens in the palace. Yet her life was cut short by a dark spell and now she dances only within the pages of this epic sage. This is her royal garb found within a shabby shack, a trade outpost catering to adventurers.  Cross the threshold and they say you can still hear the fierce princess dancing by a fire old, strangely devoid of smoke. The shack was once said to be haunted, and this mask seals the deal!",
