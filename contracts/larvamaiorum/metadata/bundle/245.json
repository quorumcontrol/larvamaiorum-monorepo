  "name": "Forlorn Mask",
  "description": "This mask can trace its origins to a wisp lost from another plane of existence at the edge of the sky. The particular story that led to this mask coming into existence is more sad, than terrible. A fragment of this spirit sought refuge on the edge of the Crypto-Roman empire and lent shelter to those who entered its domain. After centuries of isolation, the wisp vanished in a streak of light as a result of an elaborate, cruel trick played by nameless evil.",
