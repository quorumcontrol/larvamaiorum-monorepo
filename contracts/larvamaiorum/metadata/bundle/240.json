  "description": "The mood of an atheist was unparalleled and they were seen at the edge of a chapel where they were thinking furiously in their head. After some unearthly unrest, they became quite at ease and searched for a bottle on the chapel grounds. The bottle opened and out popped a strange creature with a wide smile on his face, wearing this odd mask. The atheist thought it might be friendly and quickly walked over. Seconds later, he had disappeared and the only witness to this odd happening was the traitorous champion, who was across the way from the chapel during the incident.",
