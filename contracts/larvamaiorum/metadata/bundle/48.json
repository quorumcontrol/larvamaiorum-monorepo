  "description": "The Solar Mask possesses countless powers, according to legend. Supposedly a relic of long lost empire, the mirror embedded in the mask's forehead emits a powerful blast of light.  Supposedly the mask can also detect life within a short range, the beam rendering fruit fertile. Another legend divulges that this mask absorbs all of the nutrients from a harvested plant so that it is completely dried out and brittle. These are only some of the many powers this ancient mask is  said to possess.",
