  "name": "Gorthin's Chaos Mask",
  "description": "Gorthin was a feared and respected raiding clansman for his fury and cunning. Along with his chaos mask, he took up a life of crime, but claiming to be simply misunderstood. By all accounts, his life should be repudiated and dismissed but recent tales insist that he had a great and honorable death. The Chaos Mask carries a curse of immunity to the forces of order that cannot be recreated by any craftsman alive.",
