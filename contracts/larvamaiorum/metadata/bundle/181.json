  "name": "Revenant's Mask",
  "description": "Rumors increased when a corpulent salesman stopped his cart at the gates of Anet, city of the dead, to distribute brochures on funeral duties. He had with him a casket, within which lay the gaping cadaver of a child, with deep wounds across its back, holding a mask in its teeth. This object was sacred to the inhabitants of Anet. They sought it fiercely to whatever outcome, no one knows. All that's left of this event is a troubled spirit, now known only as the Seller, who will curse much misfortune onto the foolhardy adventurer who dares to wear his mask.",
