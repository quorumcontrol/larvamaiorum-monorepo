  "description": "Deep in the imperial sands there is a rumored maze, made of ivory and gems. A creature resides deep within it, without a face and without dreams.  Travelers who have the fortune to cross paths with this beast say that the Mazebeast is a creature of night who seeks the alliance of others. He has traded a spare few masks from his collections to travellers in exchange for stories and favors.",
