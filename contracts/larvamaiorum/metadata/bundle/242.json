  "description": "The legend of the powerful, motherless sea witch who abandoned her firstborn child is told in hushed tones on the east coast of the old continent. They say she created Death inside her womb, and that like a loyal servant, Death did nothing to stop her son from being cast away after the babe's birth. The Gravity Graven mask was taken from the depths of their sunken, forbidden sanctuary beneath the earth when Death made his final return to her side. She gifted it to her son for the many generations he served as her champion, and for those he would yet to claim.",
