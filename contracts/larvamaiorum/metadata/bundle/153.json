  "description": "Stay Open minded. That's the only slogan this company has. They don't want to put their name on the masks, they just want their slogan be appreciated by the masses. The plain pith mask is a testament to the company's modesty, but it also has blank plastic eyes that behoove a sense of caution. This makeshift hero does not want to take responsibility for its own claims, for it does not want the public to rely too heavily on them, either. The company motto has more to do with the airlessness of their work than anything else.",
