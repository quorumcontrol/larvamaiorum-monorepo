  "name": "Crown of Thorns Mask",
  "description": "The archpriest slays this chosen one, who gladly submits themselves to such a holy sacrifice. Sharing its blood with the chasm so that empty but sanctified in the death , he has crowned it as an idol of thorns. Serene, the hero smiles deep within their wounds as the final light is extinguished.  A fitting death for one who so willingly accepted the crown.  This mask symbolizes an acceptance of mortality and the defeat of dreams.",
