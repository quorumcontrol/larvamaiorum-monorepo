  "description": "Only the bravest souls make their way to a place where legends have it that the winds whisper with spectral tales of a horror we cannot even comprehend. This horror lurks in the ancient Necropolis, absorbing unwary travelers at the drop of a helix. It is said that this horror oozed forth onto the land and became one with the wail of reality, growing its mask from its own body.",
