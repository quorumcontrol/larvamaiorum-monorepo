  "description": "In the Land of Roys, the natives were fearful of the unusual cold that gripped the air and snow that hid everything in peoples' yards. With snow covering his cloaks, a new traveler traversed town and found the people bundled up in their rooms. He couldn't find a single person out of doors, not even in their yard. Though it was evening, he stayed because he had no other place to take shelter, and quickly realized why the children had vanished from sight. A shady figure could be spotted through the ivory blizzard and his wicked grin could be made out through the white. Right behind this stranger was a devilish man cloaked in shadow, wearing this fearsome mask!",
