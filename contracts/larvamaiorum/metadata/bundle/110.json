  "description": "The Shining Queen has decreed that every two thousand, four hundred and fifty years, her followers must perform a most sacred ritual. This ritual requires them to journey under the cover of darkness with meager belongings deep into the Land of Wurms, until they find and retrieve a Wormcatcher Mask (Only a Queen could find and retrieve it). This Queen never wished to have any conjoint function with her throne. She had always enjoyed treasures and riches for hidden wonders.",
