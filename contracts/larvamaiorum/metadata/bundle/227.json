  "name": "Kongor's Hate",
  "description": "This mask has an immobile jaw that immobilizes the wearer's mouth, preventing them from speaking. Kongor, a three hundred foot tall apelike creature that protects his home in the middle of a vast jungle from the encroaching waves of humanity, hurls boulders at any and all intruders. He happened to throw this mask at one such intruder. Kongor's Hate is an enigmatic relic from an age long lost. What civilization possessed an armor that could withstand the overwhelming brute force of Kongor, and what does this headgear tell us about its history?",
