  "description": "Deep in the steamy jungles to the north, in a cave full of snakes, spiders, and other nasties, only the bravest of fiends would tarry. Enough courage was found to explore as deep as can be hacked through a crawling ravine.  To reward their courage and make it safe for a general to cross this gully, a trove of items from ages past were found, including this castmask. The face is said to not fit any living person though it gives a sense of meanness that is enough for most warlords.",
