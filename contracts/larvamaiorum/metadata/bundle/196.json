  "description": "The Nortons, an unusually progressive Retro Viking tribe, had taken an interest in the arts of life. It was an interest that was poorly understood, but one which led to the great schism that would destroy the Norton people from within. For where the Nortons were able to advance themselves technologically, the more traditional members of their culture saw it as a breaking of sacred traditions that had lasted from the earliest of memories. It was these traditionalists who first designed this peculiar sentinel's mask for the rising darkness.",
