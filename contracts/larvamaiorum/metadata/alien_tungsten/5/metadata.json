  "description": "The Voice of the Forgotten Mask spoke deeply, painting pictures with rich and vibrant words. For those able to hear it, the Voice transcended space, time and human imagination. It spoke of kingdoms beyond empires, great ruptures in time that echoed across the world. The heroes consigned themselves to oblivion, to live in a world without this Voice.",
