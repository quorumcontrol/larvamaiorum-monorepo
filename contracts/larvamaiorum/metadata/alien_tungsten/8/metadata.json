  "description": "Deep in the Western jungles, the people of the villages tell a tale of the destruction of an elder civilization. Hundreds of years ago, they say, there was a great empire that fell because one of its kings had been cursed. He was no longer able to walk, so he had a crown of minerals painstakingly drilled into his forehead and weighed him down with heavy metal as a form of therapy. The man who toppled this grand empire ruled as an Emperor and bore a similar string of jewels running down his forehead. The Mantis King Mask is said to be the crown of one of these fallen warriors.",
