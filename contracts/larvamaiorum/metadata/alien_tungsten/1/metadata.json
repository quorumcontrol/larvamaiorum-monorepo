  "name": "Tribulation Ant Mask",
  "description": "The Tribulation Ant mask was found deep within the belly of a giant, red ant hungry to cling to life. A vagabond traveler took pity on the dying insect, delivering him to a farmer's care. The giant, red ant allowed this mask to be removed from his belly, and after it was removed he recovered and returned to the forest. It is a great mystery how the mask ended up in the ant's abdomen in the first place.",
