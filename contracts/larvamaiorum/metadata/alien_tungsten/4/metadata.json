  "description": "The Cosmic Ghost! It is rumored that the mask was snatched away from a feathered ghoul during violent clashes in the mountains of the East. Supposedly the creature opened a doorway and unleashed a fleet of beings that wreaked havoc across the East.  Whatever is to be truth, this mask is careworn by many battles.  It's now believed that the mask was worn by the winged beast during its visit as a symbol of authority and power.",
